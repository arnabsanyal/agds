This repository contains the programming assignments for this coursera course. There are four programming assignments, one per week. The code is in python

### Important

* I used python [version 2.7.14]
* I have used a python library namely *progressbar*. You need to install it and to do so follow the steps given [here](http://progressbar-2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html, "ProgressBar installation guide")
* Should you be planning to use this code for the programming assignments, please note that coursera has an [honor code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code, "coursera honor code") and it would be unwise to break it :)
